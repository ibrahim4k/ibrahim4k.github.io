    <p>The course I have found most useful in this program
         so far is ITM 550: Advanced e-Business. It taught me how to effectively build 
         and design websites. I applied these skills outside of school 
         by redesigning my own e-commerce site. This site is presently operational and generates a modest profit.</p>
